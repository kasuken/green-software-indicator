# Green Software Indicator

A Chrome/Edge browser extension that evaluates websites for green software development practices and displays colored badges indicating their environmental sustainability.

## Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Automatically analyzes websites when you visit them
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges (green = excellent, yellow = good, red = needs improvement)
- **Detailed Breakdown**: Shows specific green software practices being followed
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks website efficiency metrics

## Green Software Practices Evaluated

1. **Image Optimization** - Uses modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) and lazy loading
2. **Minified Resources** - JavaScript and CSS files are compressed
3. **Compression** - Server-side compression enabled
4. **Reduced HTTP Requests** - Efficient resource bundling
5. **Energy Efficient Design** - Dark mode support, async loading

## Detailed Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Image Optimization (20% of score)
**What we check:**
- **Modern Formats**: Images using WebP or AVIF formats (more efficient compression)
- **Lazy Loading**: Images with `loading="lazy"` attribute to reduce initial page load
- **Threshold**: At least 50% of images must use optimization techniques

**Why it matters:** Optimized images can reduce data transfer by 25-35%, leading to lower energy consumption and faster load times.

### 2. Minified Resources (20% of score)
**What we check:**
- **JavaScript Files**: Scripts with `.min.js` extension or containing "minified" in the filename
- **CSS Files**: Stylesheets with `.min.css` extension or containing "minified" in the filename
- **Threshold**: At least 30% of external resources must be minified

**Why it matters:** Minified files reduce bandwidth usage by 10-40%, decreasing server load and energy consumption.

### 3. Compression Enabled (20% of score)
**What we check:**
- **HTTP Headers**: Meta tags indicating content encoding or compression
- **Server Configuration**: Evidence of gzip, brotli, or similar compression
- **Response Headers**: Content-Encoding headers (detected through meta tags)

**Why it matters:** Compression can reduce data transfer by 60-80%, significantly lowering network energy usage.

### 4. Reduced HTTP Requests (20% of score)
**What we check:**
- **Total Resource Count**: Combined external scripts, stylesheets, and images
- **Threshold**: Fewer than 20 external resources (indicates good bundling practices)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Evidence of sprite sheets, bundled assets, or CDN usage

**Why it matters:** Each HTTP request requires energy for DNS lookups, connection establishment, and data transfer. Fewer requests = less energy.

### 5. Energy Efficient Design (20% of score)
**What we check:**
- **Dark Mode Support**: 
  - `color-scheme` meta tag
  - `data-theme` attributes
  - CSS classes indicating dark mode
  - Black background colors
- **Async Loading**: Scripts with `async` or `defer` attributes (at least 50% of scripts)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Non-blocking resource loading patterns

**Why it matters:** Dark themes can reduce screen energy consumption by 15-60% on OLED displays. Async loading prevents render-blocking and improves efficiency.

## Scoring System

- **Excellent (70-100%)**: Green badge ✓ - 4-5 criteria met
- **Good (40-69%)**: Yellow badge ~ - 2-3 criteria met  
- **Needs Improvement (0-39%)**: Red badge ✗ - 0-1 criteria met
- **Unable to Analyze**: Gray badge ? - Technical issues or restricted content

Each criterion contributes equally (20%) to the final score. The extension provides real-time feedback and detailed breakdowns to help developers understand which practices to implement.
